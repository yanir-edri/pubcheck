# Pubcheck
no more searching each package on pub for versions
If you're a dart/flutter developer using pub for packages,
and you're tired of checking each of your packages for new updates - this is the right place for you.
# Note
I didn't have the time to style and add some css to the site, thus css pull requests will be more than welcome.
# Usage
simply copy your dependencies as-is to the textarea,
and the sophisticated node.js server (which is hosted with ðŸ’— by heroku) will fetch all the newest versions, just for you.
